# Friends-or-BlockedUsers-Plugin
This is a Rust plugin that allows for the use of blocked people as well as friends. This plugin was made by using the plugin made by [MrBlue at uMod](https://umod.org/plugins/friends) and adding to it. As such, it's not really my creation, but my modification of an already existing code. Please support MrBlue if you do like this plugin.
This can hopefully be used in tandem with the NTeleportaion modication I am hopefully soon to make. This will allow you to block users and NOT allow them to teleport to you.
