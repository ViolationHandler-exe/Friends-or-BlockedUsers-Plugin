# Friends-or-BlockedUsers-Plugin
This is a Rust plugin that allows for the use of blocked people as well as friends. This plugin was made by using the plugin made by [MrBlue at uMod](https://umod.org/plugins/friends) and adding to it. As such, it's not really my creation, but my modification of an already existing code. Please support MrBlue if you do like this plugin.

This plugin was made in a way that uploaded the ORIGINAL code first, and then edited it so you can compare and see any changes I had made. If you don't trust its the original code, do exactly the same thing, go get the orignal code from [MrBlue at uMod](https://umod.org/plugins/friends) and upload to a private GitHub repository, then edit the code you put in with my code, and you can see what has changed.

This can hopefully be used in tandem with the NTeleportaion modication I am hopefully soon to make. This will allow you to block users and NOT allow them to teleport to you.
